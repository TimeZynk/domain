# Domain

Domain is, at its roots, a domain type declartion DSL, written in Clojure.

The type declarations can be used

* to autogenerate REST APIs
* to validate input data
* to persist data in Mongo DB

## Assembly Line

The assembly line is designed to create data workflows with different stations where the processing can be done. It can easily be extend with new stations. You can run it up to a specific station, pause it, resume it and execute it asynchronously.
