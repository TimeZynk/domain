com.timezynk.domain
-------------------

The tzbackend.future.domain.core namespace is built around the DomainTypeFactory.

The DomainTypeFactory implements the Persistence protocol. It contains assembly lines
for all crud operations. These are quite complex and handles validation from different
perspectives (like type checks, contract like functionality and mandatory fields),
default values and so on.

These assembly lines uses future.mongo to communicate with the database. Every
DomainTypeFactory is tied to a collection via the :collection-factory field.
These factories take the dom-type options as argument and produce a suitable
implementation of the Relation protocol.

*** Defining the DomainTypeFactory

DomainTypeFactories are created via the defdomtype macro â€“ the DomainTypeFactory constructor.
